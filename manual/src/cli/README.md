# Command Line Solver

The command line solver can be installed or updated using `cargo install
--force varisat-cli`. Cargo can be installed using
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Varisat follows the basic conventions used by most other SAT solvers. If you've
used a SAT solver before, you'll likely know how to use varisat. If you
haven't, you can read the next chapter to learn how to use varisat. In any case
make sure to check out the built in command line help using `varisat --help`.
